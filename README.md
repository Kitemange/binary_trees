A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

## Difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure.htm). On the other hand, in a binary search trees, A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.
